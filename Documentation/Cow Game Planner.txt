Player must abduct healthy cows as they move across the screen
Sick cows should be avoided
Swipe up to use tractor beam on cows
Double tap a location to move to that point
Cowtapults eventually come in from the sides and shoot at the UFO
	- As game goes on, they move, aim, and shoot faster
	- Arc of the cow is shown when first starting game and then disappears later if player can survive long enough

Different types of cows give different points
	- Regular cows
	- Chocolate cows
	- Strawberry cows
	- Coconut cows
	- Almond cows
	- Soy cows
	- Goat cows
	- Golden cows
	- Mad cows (infect cows already on UFO and cost points)

Can spend points (or raw cows of different types) at the end of each level to conduct research and upgrade the UFO?
