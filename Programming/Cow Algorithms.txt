Cow Spawning Algorithm (Endless Mode):

variables to consider:
-time elapsed since begninning of game
-how often to refresh the spawn function
-speed of cows



things to consider:
-refresh spawn function every n seconds, "rolls" to see if it should spawn a cow
-frequency should be steadily random, but not static
-speed of cows should increase gradually
-speed should also be steadily random, so cows move at slightly different speeds


Algorithm:

bool cowSpawn(double speed) // every n seconds, recall this function to decide whether to spawn a cow or not
{
	bool spawn; // determines whether to spawn a cow or not in this execution
	int x = rand() % 10; // random number between 0 and 9
	
	// ~66% chance of spawning a cow (can be tweaked as necessary)
	if (x >= 0 && x <= 3)
		spawn = false;
	else
		spawn = true;
	return spawn;
}

// if cowSpawn returns true, call cowSpeed to determine newly spawned cow's speed:

double cowSpeed(int gameTime, double const SPEED_CONST) //
{
	double speed;
	double RANDOM = rand() % 1; // random number between 0 and 1
	
	speed = speed * SPEED_CONST * RANDOM; // multiply by some constant and a randm
					      // number between 0 and 1 (MUST be greater
					      // than 0 and less than/equal to 1)

	return speed;
}
